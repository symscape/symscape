    <p>I have followed this video guide on how to simulate airflow in a sectioned object</p>

<p>But I get stuck at the 3:15 part where it says to interesect both volumes. My problem is that when I import my sketchup model it imports as a face, nothing else. There is no volume, no edges, nothing imported but a face.</p>
<p>Here is an image showing the object that I am trying to evaluate and the problem described:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/0jWSetZ.png" title="http://i.imgur.com/0jWSetZ.png">http://i.imgur.com/0jWSetZ.png</a></p>
<p>I can't get past that point and I can't find another way to simulate the airflow around that object. All I want is to see how the air behaves with shapes like that one.</p>
<p>I have also followed the export/import  instructions that were provided here <a href="1247.html" title="www.symscape.com/node/1247">www.symscape.com/node/1247</a></p>
<p>Is there any way that I can turn that into a volume or any other way to simulate the airflow around an object like that one, something like the sphynx simulation <a href="../blog/great-sphinx-cfd-wind-erosion-study.html" title="www.symscape.com/blog/great-sphinx-cfd-wind-erosion-study">www.symscape.com/blog/great-sphinx-cfd-wind-erosion-study</a></p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Assuming your SketchUp faces bound a watertight volume (which is rare), i.e., each edge is connected to exactly 2 faces,  you can use the <strong>Volumes-&gt;Stitch tool (Topology Only = True)</strong> on the <strong>Geometry</strong> Tool Palette. Then you can use the <strong>Booleans-&gt;Subtract (Topology Only = True)</strong> tool to subtract that volume from a larger bounding box ensuring that none of the SketchUp geometry faces intersect or are coincident with your bounding box.</p>
<p>You have to use the <strong>Topology Only</strong> option for each tool because you don't have native analytic geometry. SketchUp is a faceted modeler. Faceted geometry can not take part in standard geometry operations.</p>

    <p>I have used the stich tool with topology only set to true and it created a new volume. Then I positioned the bounding box so that the object would not be intersecting or touching the box. Then I set topology only to true in the subtract boolean and selected both the bounding box and the new volume that was previously created.</p>
<p>Now I only have the bounding box and still no volume created from the sketchup model. I gave a quick look at the sketchup model and I can't see any edge that isn't connected to exactly 2 faces, I even looked inside the model for any edge that could be connected to a 3rd face that wasn't visible and there was none. As far as I can see the model is a watertight volume.</p>
<p>I even tried with a more simple sketchup model, a uniform cube, and I still faced the same problems. I don't know what else I can do.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>If your original SketchUp model had only a single face, which it appears to do, then when you subtract it from the bounding box then it will not have any edges visible (there are none). If you shade all faces and then make one of the bounding box faces transparent you will see the SketchUp model faces inside.</p>
<p>However, it would be better if you split the original SketchUp faces to form feature edges visible in Caedium. You can do this in SketchUp by naming groups of facets and/or in Caedium select <strong>File-&gt;Preferences</strong>, then in the <strong>Properties Panel</strong> set <strong>Import-&gt;Faceted-&gt;Facet Feature Angle = 30</strong>, or something similar until you get edges showing up after import.</p>

    <p>What you suggested in the first sentence was the first thing I tried, I thought that maybe I couldn't see anything because there were no edges, so I faced everything but one of the bounding boxe's faces and there was nothing inside.</p>
<p>I also changed the facet feature angle and it only started showing edges below +/-5. I set it to 1, which showed all the edges and I repeated what you said in your first comment, still made no difference. I still cannot turn that into a volume that the program can work with, it either crashes, or gives an error about something not being native geometry.</p>
<p>I never thought this would be so complicated.</p>

    <p>I can not reproduce the disappearing geometry.</p>
<p>I just managed to create a complete simulation according to:</p>
<ol>
<li>File-&gt;Preferences, Import-&gt;Faceted-&gt;Facet Feature Angle = 15</li>
<li>Import your dae file, you should see a series of circular edges representing your geometry</li>
<li>Volumes-&gt;Stitch, Topology Only = true, select all faces to create 'volume'</li>
<li>Volumes-&gt;Box, Lengths = [1 1 1], to create 'volume_1'</li>
<li>Transforms-&gt;Translate, Translate = [-0.5 -0.5 -0.5] applied to 'volume_1' to center it around your imported geometry</li>
<li>Booleans-&gt;Subtract, Topology Only = true, select 'volume_1', then 'volume' (order is important) to create 'volume_2'</li>
<li>Faces-&gt;Join applied to skinny (sliver) faces to produce larger faces, while preserving most of the key feature edges</li>
<li>Setup the substance, etc. as in the tutorials</li>
</ol>
<p>I suggest for a more accurate simulation you use the <a href="723.html">Accuracy tool</a> on some of the high curvature faces.</p>
<p>You can download a rough proof of concept simulation at <a href="../files/downloads/flute.zip">flute.zip</a>.</p>

    <p>I have been non-stop for over 5 hours trying to replicate what you did but I cannot achieve the same result. </p>
<p>I don't understand the "Faces-Join" part, it makes everything into 2 faces without any edges, I can't create an inlet, outlet faces and walls to achieve the same result.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea how you made that and I have followed your instructions, analysed your file hundreds of times and I have searched the forums for any help but none was found, I am completely lost here.</p>
<p>It should be more easier than this to convert a sketchup import into a volume because this is a nightmare.</p>

    <p>I have managed to join the sliver faces, I joined the same that you have, but now I am stuck with a big box that is missing the shape of the object inside. I have set the walls and added Air to the volume but it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>I have read the mesh troubleshooting guide and found that when I use the Scalar Fields-&gt;Vol it creates a big blob outside my box. When I do the same with the file you made it shows the volume inside the box as it is expected.</p>
<p>I analyzed my mesh and everything looks ok so I don't understand what is happening. Do I still have to reverse the resulting box subtraction? I think all I have now is something like the second image from point 3: <a href="../blog/5-tips-for-cfd-flow-volume-creation.html" title="http://www.symscape.com/blog/5-tips-for-cfd-flow-volume-creation">http://www.symscape.com/blog/5-tips-for-cfd-flow-volume-creation</a></p>

    <p>There's no point in trying to setup the physics if your geometry isn't correct.</p>
<p>For the subtract operation you have to select the box then the SketchUp volume. The first selection is the volume that will have subsequently selected volumes removed from it. The bounding box has to totally enclose the SketchUp volume.</p>
<p>You only need to join maybe about 5 sliver faces, you still want to have feature edges in the high curvature regions. When complete you should have quite a few edges still visible. Click <strong>Home-&gt;Start</strong> (reset) on the simulation I shared to see what the final flow volume edges should look like.</p>

    <p>I followed your instructions exactly like you said and I even redid it just now to re-confirm, and this is what I am left with after subtracting following the order that you mentioned and also after joining a few of the objects' faces. </p>
<p>Left is your file, right is the one I just did after the subtract and joining slivers part:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/o8mQhxE.png" title="http://i.imgur.com/o8mQhxE.png">http://i.imgur.com/o8mQhxE.png</a></p>
<p>As you can see, until that part everything appears to be as it should, but past that part nothing works as it should. I add air substance to the volume, apply walls to all faces, add inlet to the left wall of the box and outlet to the right wall and then I try to run vector field U applied to the volume and this is what happens; left without U and right with U, both at the same angle and view distance:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/WH2rWL4.png" title="http://i.imgur.com/WH2rWL4.png">http://i.imgur.com/WH2rWL4.png</a></p>
<p>As you can see, the vector is running outside the volume or leaking outside the volume, it is not being contained. Nothing like the one you made.</p>

    <p>Instead of creating the volume and surface meshes in one step by requesting the velocity, first assign <strong>Scalar Fields-&gt;E Ratio</strong> (which is a surface mesh quality metric) to all your faces - watch for warnings/errors in the Properties Panel. To view the individual elements see <a href="532.html">"View Mesh"</a>.</p>
<p>If any of the your faces fail to surface mesh then the volume mesh will leak as you are seeing. If there are warnings then try applying <strong>Accuracy = Custom, Resolution = 40</strong> or higher onto your SketchUp faces. This will cause the surfaces to remesh hopefully without warnings then you can proceed to assign velocity (which will create the volume mesh, again watch for warnings/errors) and run the simulation.</p>

    <p>I also did the last steps you indicated but this time on your file and it also showed a box with collored crosses exactly like my file.</p>
<p>This time I did what you told me, just E-Ratio on both files, yours and mine. I also set the faces to flat and assigned accuracy 40 to the sketchup faces on both files, here is the result; left is your file, right is my file:</p>

<p>Yours completed with no errors or warnings while mine showed that it exceeded maximum triangle count. Regardless, it still created the polygon mesh exactly like in the other file.</p>

    <p>Maximum triangle count warning means the meshing stopped on a face, which will cause the volume mesh to fail. As part of the message there is a link (www...), click it and it will select the face that caused the warning. Delete the Accuracy property on that face to avoid over resolving it.</p>

    <p>I removed the accuracy on the face that was causing the problem and ran the E-ratio without any issues this time. Then I tried to plot the vector field U to the volume and it still did the same as before, showed outside the box in a big blob of arrows.</p>

    <p>Thanks for sharing the project file. Certainly the volume mesh looks wrong - inside out. If you assign <strong>Vector Field-&gt;Normal</strong> to all faces you can see the vectors on the bounding box point inwards, whereas they should point outwards.</p>
<p>My best guess at what happened is that you subtracted the bounding box from the SketchUp volume. You need to be sure when you drag and drop <strong>Booleans-&gt;Subtract</strong> you first select the bounding box volume in the <strong>Select Dialog</strong>, click <strong>OK</strong>, click <strong>Select/Deselect</strong>, select the SketchUp stitched volume in the <strong>Select Dialog</strong>, click <strong>OK</strong>, then confirm the operation by clicking <strong>Done</strong>.</p>
<p>Also you don't need to bother assigning Accuracy, as I suggested earlier, at least while you are producing a first pass simulation.</p>

    <p>The problem was really with the subtract selection. From your previous instructions I was making the selection incorrectly.</p>
<p>Once I dropped the subtract I was selecting the box and then the sketchup in the same selection window by holding Ctrl key. I thought that this was what you meant that I should do the selection like that while hold Ctrl key down.</p>
<p>Now that you specified exactly how that selection is done I was able to finally achieve a working result.</p>

<p>Indeed the subtracting result was the inverse, no wonder the software was always plotting outside of it.</p>
<p>Thank you so very much for all your support, now I am able to continue evaluating your software during this trial and study. One thing is certain, support here has been excelent</p>

    <p>Great to see your progress. A couple more pointers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always create a <strong>Residual Monitor</strong>, as in all the <a href="817.html">RANS Flow tutorials</a>, to see how the solvers are behaving. Without it you can't be sure that your results are meaningful.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="723.html">Accuracy tool</a> selectively on certain faces to better resolve your geometry around high curvature regions.</li>

    <p>I have been trying to replicate your file by following all your steps, my problem is that when I reach the point "Faces -&gt; Join" everything becomes one volume with 2 faces without any edges; the outside box and the inside shape become one face part of the same volume.</p>
<p>When I follow this step, none of the edges are being preserved and I don't understand why.  I have tried just joining the box faces and then the object, all faces, both objects and every 2 connected faces, the result is always the same, the edges are not being preserved.</p>

    <p>It finally works, well at least the file you provided does. I am studying the Venturi effect and the wakes on shapes similar and equal to the one I am using. Although you have used a top to bottom air flow, I managed to change it to a lateral flow and finally observe what I was looking for, the way the air drags itself inwards and then wakes on the opposite counter-shape.</p>
<p>I will be using your guide for importing the other similar shapes from now on and use the file you provided as support as well.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for all your help.</p>
